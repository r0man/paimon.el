/Paimon or Paymon is one of the Kings of Hell, more obedient to/
/Lucifer than other kings are, and has two hundred legions of demons/
/under his rule/

** Usage

Install the package from [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]] and run =M-x paimon= to search in your
[[https://www.splunk.com/][Splunk]] enterprise. If you haven't configured a /paimon.el/ profile
yet, you will be guided through the setup process.

** Quick Start

You can try out /paimon.el/ by searching the Splunk server that comes
with the [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/][Docker Compose]] file in this repository.

Let's start the Splunk server with the following command:

#+begin_src sh
  docker-compose up
#+end_src

Next, run =M-x paimon= and follow the instructions to setup a
/paimon.el/ profile for the local Splunk server. You will be asked to
enter the following information and whether the password should be
saved or not:

- Authentication type: =basic=
- HTTP Protocol: =https=
- Hostname: =localhost=
- Port: =8089=
- Identity: =admin=
- Password: =12345678=

After entering this information you will end up in the
=*paimon-search-jobs*= buffer.

Let's search the =_internal= index of the local Splunk server by
pressing =c=. You will be asked to enter a [[https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.4/SearchReference/Search][search command]]. Enter =*=
to search for everything.

Next, you will see a [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] based menu where you can select some
search options like the indexes, earliest and latest time of the
search, etc.

Press =-i=, enter the =_internal= as the index and press =c= again to
create a Splunk search job.

You will see that a search job got created in the
=*paimon-search-jobs*= buffer, and another buffer will pop up that
shows the search results once preview results are available or the
search has been completed.

The search results buffer will show the first 250 results. To show the
next page of results press =N=, to go back to the previous page press
=P=.

That's it. For more help on the keybindings press =C-h m=.

** Profiles

Profiles are used by /paimon.el/ to decide which Splunk server is
used. A profile contains the HTTP protocol, the host and the port of
the Splunk server, as well as the authentication type and the identity
which is used to obtain the credential. You can list the available
profiles with =M-x paimon-list-profiles=.

In the =*paimon-profiles*= buffer you can create (=c=), delete (=D=),
set the default (=d=), or select (=RET=) a profile.

** Authentication

This package uses the Emacs's [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html][auth-source]] library to obtain the
credential used to authenticate with a Splunk server. It supports [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617][HTTP
Basic]] or [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750][HTTP Bearer]] authentication. When setting up a profile you
will be asked for a credential and whether it should be saved for
future sessions or not.

If you choose to save the credential, it will be saved in one of the
files listed in =auth-sources=. The saved credentials of the Splunk
server that comes with the [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/][Docker Compose]] file in this repository
looks like this:

#+begin_example
  machine localhost login admin port 8089 password 12345678
#+end_example

Credentials are cached by Emacs's [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html][auth-source]] library for the current
Emacs session. If you entered something wrong, run =M-x
auth-source-forget-all-cached= and try again.
